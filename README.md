# Website Traffic and Donations Analysis

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive examination of website traffic and donation data for the year 2023. It leverages two complementary approaches:

- **Python Data Analysis**:  
  Data is cleaned, analyzed, and visualized, yielding insights into regional performance, temporal trends, and conversion rates.
  
- **SQL Database Optimization**:  
  The strategy is to optimize a retail analytics database. the focuse is on performance, maintainability, and efficiency as data volumes grow, covering indexing, CTEs, join optimization, partitioning, materialized views, and more.

Together, these tasks demonstrate an integrated approach to both data processing and database optimization for scalable analytics.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Quality Assurance**:  
  Robust handling of missing and invalid data with detailed logging.
  
- **In-depth Analysis**:  
  - Regional performance breakdown  
  - Temporal trends and quarterly overviews  
  - Conversion rate insights
  
- **Visualization**:  
  Comprehensive charts and graphs to reveal key patterns.
  
- **SQL Optimization**:  
  Advanced techniques including targeted indexing, partitioning, and materialized views for efficient query performance.
  
- **Logging & Process Tracking**:  
  Detailed logs capture every step, facilitating troubleshooting and iterative improvement.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13.0 or later** (for the Python analysis)
- **SQL Environment**: A modern RDBMS that supports the optimization techniques outlined (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- **Required Python Libraries**:  
  - pandas  
  - numpy  
  - matplotlib  
  - seaborn  
  - jupyter notebook

## Installation

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Analysis

### Python Data Analysis

1. **Using Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Open `notebooks/traffic_analysis.ipynb`
   - Run cells sequentially (or use "Run All") to execute the full analysis.

2. **Command Line Execution**:
   ```bash
   python traffic_data_analysis.py --input data/traffic_data.csv --output output
   ```

### SQL Optimization Strategy

- **Review the SQL Documentation**:  
  See `sql/optimization_strategy.md` for detailed instructions on the database optimization techniques.
- **Deploy & Test in a Staging Environment**:  
  Implement the provided SQL scripts on your retail analytics database to validate performance improvements before production deployment.

## Analysis Methodology

### Python Task

- **Data Cleaning Steps**:
  - Handle missing values and remove invalid rows.
  - Convert date formats and create derived columns.
- **Analysis Dimensions**:
  1. **Regional Analysis**: Total donations, donation value, conversion rates.
  2. **Temporal Analysis**: Monthly trends, quarterly overviews, day of week performance.
- **Visualization**:  
  Generates charts (e.g., regional donation value, conversion rates, monthly trends) that provide insights into the data.

### SQL Task

- **Optimization Techniques**:
  1. **Indexing Strategy**: Targeted indexes on critical columns to improve query performance.
  2. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Enhance readability and maintainability.
  3. **Join Optimization**: Explicit JOIN syntax with early filtering.
  4. **Partitioning Strategy**: Date-based partitioning for large tables.
  5. **Materialized Views**: Precompute aggregations for faster reporting.
  6. **Handling Data Skew**: Strategies for managing customer data variations.
  7. **Incremental Processing**: For real-time analytics dashboards.

## Logging & Troubleshooting

- **Logging**:  
  Detailed logs are available in `output/analysis.log`, capturing data loading, cleaning steps, analysis progress, and any warnings or errors.
  
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - **Missing Libraries**: Ensure all prerequisites are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
  - **Data Issues**: Check input CSV format and verify column names.
  - **Performance Considerations**: Optimized for datasets up to 100,000 rows using vectorized pandas operations.

## AI Utilization

This project leverages AI tools to enhance productivity and code quality:

- **Python Task**:  
  GitHub Copilot was used to generate suggestions and improvements in the website traffic and donations analysis code. Its recommendations were carefully reviewed, tested, and refined to meet production standards.
  
- **SQL Task**:  
  Copilot assisted in debugging complex SQL queries and refining optimization strategies, ensuring efficient and maintainable database operations.
  
- **Documentation & READMEs**:  
  AI tools contributed to crafting clear and detailed documentation, streamlining the creation of comprehensive READMEs that articulate the project structure and methodology.
